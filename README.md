Robotics in Gardening
This project explores the use of robotics in gardening tasks such as planting, watering, and weeding. By utilizing automation and artificial intelligence, we aim to enhance gardening efficiency, reduce labor costs, and promote sustainable practices.

Features
Robotic systems for planting and seed placement
Automated watering and irrigation systems
AI-powered weeding robots for weed detection and removal
Data collection for soil and plant health monitoring
Integration with smart home systems for garden management
How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Connect the robot to the garden setup via the provided interface, and use the control system to automate tasks like watering and weeding.

For testing AI models and robotic functions, run:

bash
Copy
python robot_gardener.py
How It Works
Planting: The robot uses sensors to identify the best locations for planting, ensuring optimal soil depth and spacing.
Watering: Integrated sensors detect soil moisture levels and activate watering systems only when necessary, conserving water.
Weeding: AI algorithms allow the robot to distinguish between plants and weeds, ensuring only unwanted plants are removed.
Monitoring: The robot continuously gathers data on plant health, including temperature, humidity, and soil conditions, to provide insights for garden care.
